# Realtime notification using Spring Boot / Kafka and Angular


To run this project, you need to Docker compose and you need to run the command `docker-compose up --build` to launch Kafka.
After that, launch the `producer and the consumer`.

Then, you can launch the `Angular app`.

After that, `publish a notification` (for example with __Postman__). You can retrieve the URI and the model of the notification object in the producer package.
